Available projects:

PCA Analysis of Quasar UV Spectra (Advanced Astronomy Data Science Class Project) | April 2025 |
- Reproduced the characteristic inverse relationship between received Quasar light (flux) and distance (redshift) using Principal Component Analysis
- Reconstructed full quasar continuum spectra from red-side spectral weights to reproduce mean transmitted flux vs. redshift relation through dimensionality reduction of high-resolution UV data
- Implemented advanced spectroscopic analysis techniques using Python with astronomical data processing libraries
- Solutions built using: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), SDSS Data, Data Cleaning, Python (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Astropy)

Analysis of One-Dimensional Thermal Conductivity (Computational Physics Class Project) | March 2025 |
- Confirmed 1D thermal conductivity behavior in space and time along a copper rod matches Modified Heat Equation predictions
- Performed statistical analysis and data analytics with Python and numerical computations with C++ (faster)
- Solutions built using: Python (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas), C++, LaTeX, Laboratory Instrumentation, Statistical Analysis

Deming Regression Analysis of Tully-Fisher Relation (Advanced Astronomy Data Science Class Project) | March 2025 |
- The relationship between galaxy luminosity and rotational speed predicts galaxy distance
- Extended the analysis to early/late-type spiral galaxies to get a more accurate distance indicator
- Performed novel Bayesian linear regression analysis accounting for X and Y uncertainties in galaxy velocity-luminosity data
- Solutions built using: Deming Regression (Bayesian), SPARC galaxy data, Bootstrapping, Python (Pandas, Numpy)

NFL Data Analysis (Big Data Science Class Project) | November 2024 |
- Trained neural network and random forest models to analyze 50,000+ NFL plays and predict pivotal NFL plays with 75%+ precision
- Predicted fumble probability and identified key correlational features while classifying shotgun vs. non-shotgun formations
- Solutions built using: Python (Scikit-Learn, Keras, Pandas, Plotly, Numpy), Neural Network, Random Forest
